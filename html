building. Below are the three major iterations of my personal machine and how it has evolved. <br>

  In addition to these are at least 5 to 6 machines made with or for personal friends.</p>

  
 <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:red; padding:1em">
As you can most likely see from my builds, I am quite fond of Ryzen-based systems as <br>

it gives the consumer a much better value for performance than Intel can offer. <br>

I also like the higher thread counts for less money as I personally like to stream <br>

on Twitch and utilize the extra cores and threads for Software x264 encoding.</p>

 <center><p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:red; padding:1em"> <font color="white"> A common theme noiceable between all my builds are my favorite colors to <br>use when themeing a build.  The colors frequently chosen in my builds are a <br> tribute to the neon, Miami nights of the 80's. While not only aesthetically pleasing,<br> it can be argued that modern computer-centric culture started to develop in<br> the 80's with an increasing fascination in sci-fi and futuristic technology.</p>
