<p><center><font color = "white"> I have built several computers for both myself and other friends in my years of PC <br>

building. Below are the three major iterations of my personal machine and how it has evolved. <br>

In addition to these are at least 5 to 6 machines made with or for personal friends. <br><br>

As you can most likely see from my builds, I am quite fond of Ryzen-based systems as <br>

it gives the consumer a much better value for performance than Intel can offer. <br>

I also like the higher thread counts for less money as I personally like to stream <br>

on Twitch and utilize the extra cores and threads for Software x264 encoding.</p>
